This project demonstrates how to use neovim-rs. It runs Neovim itself on the main thread, and launches a separate logging thread. The logging thread connects to Neovim over an anonymous pipe and asks to be notified of "bufenter" events (whenever you switch to a buffer). It then writes the messages it receives from Neovim to a file called events.log in the current directory. The purpose is to demonstrate how to use Neovim's msgpack-rpc protocol from Rust.
